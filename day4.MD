  - Close collaboration between cross-functional teams.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Less predictable in terms of scope, time, and budget.
  - Requires a high level of team collaboration and communication.
  - Can be challenging to manage if team members are not experienced with Agile practices.

**Waterfall:**
- **Advantages:**
  - Structured and sequential, making it easier to manage and understand.
  - Clear documentation and well-defined stages.
  - Easier to track progress against the original plan.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Inflexible to changes once the project has started.
  - Late discovery of issues or changes can be costly.
  - Limited customer involvement after the initial phases.

### 4. Suitable Projects for Agile vs. Waterfall

**Agile:**
- **Suitable for:**
  - Projects with rapidly changing requirements.
  - Software development projects where iterative feedback is beneficial.
  - Startups or new product development where the final product is not clearly defined.

**Example:** Developing a new mobile app with frequent updates based on user feedback.

**Waterfall:**
- **Suitable for:**
  - Projects with well-defined requirements and little expected change.
  - Industries requiring rigorous documentation and compliance.
  - Projects where the end product is clear and well-understood.

**Example:** Developing a software system for a government agency with strict regulatory requirements.

### 5. Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance and its Importance

**Methods:**
- **Code Reviews:** Regularly reviewing code to ensure adherence to standards.
- **Automated Testing:** Implementing unit, integration, and regression tests.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Regularly integrating and testing code to catch issues early.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involving end-users in testing to ensure the product meets their needs.
- **Documentation and Standards:** Establishing and adhering to coding standards and project documentation.

**Importance:**
- **Reliability:** Ensures the software functions as intended and is free from critical bugs.
- **User Satisfaction:** High-quality software leads to better user experiences and satisfaction.
- **Reputation:** Maintaining quality builds trust and a good reputation in the market.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Detecting issues early reduces the cost and time associated with fixing them later.

### 6. Project Scope Definition and the Role of Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

**Contribution of Project Scope:**
- **Clear Objectives:** Defines what the project will deliver, avoiding scope creep.
- **Resource Planning:** Helps in allocating resources effectively.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Ensures all stakeholders are aligned on what the project will achieve.

**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**
- **Definition:** A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work into manageable sections.
- **Usefulness:**
  - Provides a clear picture of the entire project.
  - Helps in estimating costs, time, and resources for each task.
  - Facilitates better communication and assignment of responsibilities.

### 7. Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule and Gantt Charts

**Benefits of a Detailed Project Schedule:**
- **Time Management:** Helps in tracking deadlines and identifying any delays.
- **Resource Coordination:** Ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and conflicts are minimized.
- **Progress Tracking:** Provides a roadmap to track progress and make adjustments as needed.

**Gantt Charts:**
- **Visual Representation:** Offers a clear, visual representation of the project timeline and tasks.
- **Dependency Management:** Helps in identifying task dependencies and adjusting the schedule accordingly.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Easy to see which tasks are on track and which are behind schedule.

### 8. Core Issues Addressed by Software and Their Significance

The software should address specific pain points or inefficiencies faced by the target audience. These issues could include time-consuming processes, lack of automation, data management challenges, or user experience problems. The significance lies in how these issues impact the productivity, satisfaction, or profitability of the users, making the software a valuable solution.

### 9. Importance of Clearly Defining the Problem

Clearly defining the problem helps in:
- **Targeted Solutions:** Ensuring the software addresses the specific needs and pain points of users.
- **Scope Management:** Avoiding scope creep by focusing on solving the identified problem.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the problem and the solution.

### 10. Describing the Software Solution

The software solution should be described in a way that highlights its core benefits and unique selling points, such as improved efficiency, ease of use, or innovative features. This description should be accessible to non-technical stakeholders and focus on the value the software provides.

### 11. Main Features or Functionalities that Make Software Stand Out
